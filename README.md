# Word_Counter
A simple program written in C to count the words in a paragraph assuming that the words are separated from each other by either a space or any of these punctuations (., ,(comma), !, :, ;, ?). While counting the number of words, the program will discard some common words{a, an, the, am, is, are, of, in, to, from, at} from the passage.
The program also prints the average lenth of the words (excluding the common words).
