# Word_Counter
A simple program written in C to count the words in a paragraph assuming that the words are separated from each other by either a space or any of these punctuations (., ,(comma), !, :, ;, ?). While counting the number of words, the program will discard some common words{a, an, the, am, is, are, of, in, to, from, at} from the passage.
The program also prints the average lenth of the words (excluding the common words).
Speciality : If you give extra spaces or other punctuations, the program will still return the original number of words.
Limitations : Limited punctuations. Common words are limited too. They are added just for a demo. Required common words and punctuations can be added in source code.
